ip:10.10.10.171
my ip:10.10.14.2 
open-ports:22,80

This was one of the toughest easy level box i encountered

You need to compromise three accounts to get a user flag.

First rce @ open-netadmin in this url http://10.10.10.171/ona/
With this try to get a reverse shell by plaing around with the exploit

Then we find database password @local/config/database_settings.inc.php
'db_type' => 'mysqli',
        'db_host' => 'localhost',
        'db_login' => 'ona_sys',
        'db_passwd' => 'n1nj4W4rri0R!',
        'db_database' => 'ona_default',
        'db_debug' => false,
NO info at all in the database

But use the same password to ssh and we get in as jimmy but still 
no user flag

netstat tulpn | grep LISTEN
We find a another web server running in port 52846
We find the web pages in /var/www/internal and with that we get
encrypted private key of joanna using jimmy&Revealed
Now using ssh2john we get password as bloodninjas
Finally we get the user flag

Root was very easy
sudo -l
/bin/nano /opt/priv  can be run as sudo without passwd
Once we get the nano opened press ctrl+r to read file with this
we get root flag
user:c9b2cf07d40807e62af62660f0c81b5f
root:2f907ed450b361b2c2bf4e8795d5b561
