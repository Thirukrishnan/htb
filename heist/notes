We have read only access on IPC share
This we can't read or list

So looking onto port 5985
The easiest way to detect whether WinRM is available is by seeing if the port is opened. WinRM will listen on one of two ports:
5985/tcp (HTTP)
5986/tcp (HTTPS)
If one of these ports is open, WinRM is configured and you can try entering a remote session.

With username Administartor and password Q4)sJu\Y8qz*A3?d 
this we get shell
