my ip :10.10.10.11
OS :Windows
open ports:49154,8500,135
vulnerable service:fmtp(flight message trnsport protocol 8500 port)
navigating to the site and waiting for few sec we get 
some directories and exploring them we see Cold fusion is running.
searching some exploits for it and version 8 we could see directory traversal and arbitrary file upload.
so i guess we need to get somehow admin password to execute meterpreter shell.

password is:happyday (but we get the sha1 hash which has to be decrypted)
